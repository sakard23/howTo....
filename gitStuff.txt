FIXED THE LAST COMMIT MESSAGE:
    - When you commit with wrong message.
    Example: you did git commit -m "error fxied"
              and realized there was typo
         Solution:
              undo with:
                        git commit --amend -m "error fixed"
    git commit --ammend will update and replace the most recent commit with a new commit,
          that combines any staged changes with the contents of the previous commit.
